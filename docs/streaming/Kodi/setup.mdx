# Setup
I will now begin the guide to setting up Kodi and its addons. I recommend that the **initial setup is completed on your laptop or desktop**.
Once it has been setup, you can do a backup to export to another device.

## Downloading Kodi
Here are the instructions for each platform, if you are viewing on a mobile phone, you will need to scroll horizontally to see all the different platform instructions.

import Pc from "./platform/setup/_pc.mdx";
import Android from "./platform/setup/_android.mdx"
import Apple from "./platform/setup/_ios.mdx"


<Tabs className="custom-tabs" queryString="platform">
    <TabItem value="pc" label="PC">
        <Pc />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="android" label="Android">
        <Android />
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Apple" label="Apple (Not recommend)">
        <Apple />
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
