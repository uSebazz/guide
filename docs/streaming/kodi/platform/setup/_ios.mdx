:::warning
Kodi is not available on the App Store, so it must be installed through sideloading.<br />
I recommend skipping this step and using better alternatives like <strong>Fusion</strong> or <strong>Omni</strong>.

    ### Sideload a self signed .ipa file
    :::danger[Warning]
        Currently, these methods require that Kodi be re-installed every 7 days if you are using a free iOS dev account.
    :::

    **Pre-requisites:**
    - Windows 7 or Higher
    - [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/)
    - A `.deb` file of Kodi (see this [section](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_Kodi_for_iOS#Download_Kodi_package))

    Converting the .deb to .ipa:

    Before beginning the installation, you have to convert .deb file of Kodi into .ipa. If you already know how to convert .deb into .ipa, you can skip to the installation methods below.

    - Right Click on .deb file of Kodi that you downloaded on your PC and Select 7-zip > Extract files. Click OK in the next Window.
    - Open the resulting Folder and you will find data.tar file inside. Simply extract data.tar file with Right Click > 7-zip > Extract Files.
    - Now you should have **data** folder and **data.tar** file in the folder.
    - Go inside the data folder and open Applications folder. Here you will find a folder named **Kodi.app**.
    - Here create a new folder and name it “Payload” without quotes. Now you should have 2 folders. Payload and Kodi.app folder. Make sure that the P is capital in Payload.
    - Now simply drag the Kodi.app folder and drop it on top of the Payload folder. *In other words, copy kodi.app and paste it inside Payload folder.*
    - Next you have to Right-click the Payload folder and Click 7-zip > Add to archive option.
    - A new window will pop up. Here you have to make sure that the Archive format is set to zip and name the archive ending with .ipa . Something like Kodi.ipa. After that click OK.

    Now you should have your kodi.ipa file ready for installation.

    #### Installing Kodi using Sideloadly
    Download [Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/) and install it on your PC.
    :::note
        Sideloadly is still a work-in-progress and there might be some bugs that you face while installing Kodi.
    :::

    - Connect your iDevice with your computer, and make sure that it is turned ON. If iTunes or some other program pops up then close that first.
    - Open Sideloadly and check your device is detected. Enter your Apple account, choose your Kodi ipa file and press Start button. You will be asked to enter your Apple account password and verification code. This is required by Sideloadly to sign the ipa file with your own ID.
    - Wait until Sideloadly reports process as Done. You’ll be able to see Kodi icon on your iDevice.
    - Once you see Kodi icon in your iDevice, go in Settings > General > Profiles & Device management and Trust the Apple ID you used which installation.
    - Now you should have kodi working on your iOS device.
